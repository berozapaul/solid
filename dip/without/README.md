# Dependency Inversion Principle
Based on this idea, Robert C. Martinâ€™s definition of the Dependency Inversion Principle consists of two parts:

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on 
abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
