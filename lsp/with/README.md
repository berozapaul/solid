# Liskov Substitution Principle
If `S` is a subtype of `T`, then objects of type `T` may be replaced with objects of type `S` 

Ostrich is a bird, but it can't fly, Ostrich class is a subtype of class Bird, but it shouldn't be able to use the fly method, that means we are breaking the `LSP` principle.
